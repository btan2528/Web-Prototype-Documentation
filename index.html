			<h2>The Prototype</h2>
			<p> My design for this prototype was based off the mockups presented in the web proposal, but a few changes were made to compensate for tutor and user feedback, as well as the improvement of the functionality of the website. </p>

      <p> In the proposal, a total of eight pages were proposed. However, for this prototype only three pages were created - the Home page, the About us and the give/donate page. These three pages were decided upon as they were the most important out of the original eight pages, and included a range of elements including images, forms, carousels and animations that could be prototyped. </p>

          <figcaption> Original Proposed Sitemap </figcaption>
      </figure>

       <p> To make the website responsive, the website was coded to the size Pixel 2 XL so all the elements could be correctly scaled down and positioned. </p>

       <h2> The Website Layout  </h2>
       <p> The website layout was inspired by websites like Up Banking - a smaller amount of pages but each page is longer vertically and has many different pieces of content. </p> 

       <p> Up Banking Website: https://up.com.au/about/ </p> 

       <p> The sort of vertical layout also created an appropriate information architecture - allowing users to flow through each section of the page from most to least important, without having to be directed to various other pages. </p>

       <p> A grid layout wasn't used for this prototype as there were many unresolved margin and navigation bar errors that resulted from using one. In the end it was simpler to just use sections and containers as opposed to the grid to create a more flexible and versatile layout that could adapt to changes made during the prototyping process. </p>

      <h2> The Overall Aesthetic </h2>

      <p> The general style of this website prototype was based off the proposed style guide and moodboards from the website mockups. The style is a simple, almost minimalist approach with bold pops of colour to create visual interest and emphasize certain elements. </p>

       <figure>
          <img src="styleguide.png" alt="Website prototype styleguide" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> Prototype styleguide</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p> The colour scheme of red, white and shades of grey were based off the existing HRI colour schemes, and were chosen to create colour contrast to increase the accessibility of the web pages. </p>

      <p> However, the dark greys that were originaly proposed were changed to lighter shades. They were visually a little harsh against the whites, reds and black text, and created less emphasis on the background images and headers. </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="darkgrey.png" alt="Dark grey colour scheme" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> dark grey colour scheme </figcaption>
      </figure>


      <figure>
          <img src="lightgrey.png" alt="light grey colour scheme" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> light grey colour scheme</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p> The accessibility of the website was also increased through the use of alt tags for image elements. </p>

      <h2> The Nav Bar </h2>

			<p> The navogation bar was the first thing created in the prototyping process. It was changed from the original design that was proposed, as the rounded nav bar that drooped over the background header image didn't have a proper purpose, especially if it required more technical code. And due to the fact that only three pages existed on the website instead of eight, a simpler and cleaner design was chosen that drew the eye more towards the other elements of the page. </p>

       <figure>
          <img src="oldnav.png" alt="old navigation bar" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> Old navigation bar</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
          <img src="newnav.png" alt="new navigation bar" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> new navigation bar</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p> Colour of the nav bar was chosen as crimson, the main color in the colour palette, with the 'donate' tab in a brighter white compared to the light grey of the other tabs to make the call to action stand out. </p>

      <p> The nav bar also features the HRI logo in the left hand corner to incorporate more of the instiute's branding. This image also acts as a button that links back to the landing page. Despite the navigation bar already having a link to the home page, clickable logos are very popular on websites and familiar to users, so it would be likely that users would expect it to act like a button and not just a stand alone image. Including an extra link wouldn't disrupt the navigation of the website either. </p>

      <p> The positioning of the navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page. During the prototyping process it was attempted to make the bar sticky, but since there were only 2 other pages to navigate too and the pages weren't very long vertically, the bar remained positioned at the top. </p>

      <p> The search bar located next to the nav bar was also changed. This was removed because there are only three pages on the website, only two of which are filled with actual content, so users wouldn't likely be searching for any speific content. The tutors also questioned the placement of the search bar off to the side randomly next to the search bar,so eliminating it would create a more clean and seemless look that correltated better to the fuctionality and affordances of the website. </p>

      <p> This navigation bar also scales down into a hamburger bar when converted into a mobile version. </p>
			
			<h2 id="the Web Pages">Page One: The Home Page</h2>

			<p> The HRI home page was very similar to the mockup that was propsed in the website proposal. The website opens to a large image with the HRI's catch phrase layered on top of it, instead of bombarding the users with lots of text when the page loads. This was inspired by the university marketing campaigns - large imagery with one or two sentences that inspire and encourage reflection. The text was also moved from its off-centre position to being aligned in the middle of the image to highlight its heriachy on the page and connect it with the other centered elements on the page like the news carousel. </p>

      <p> Having the users be met with the HRI's main catch phrase/message when they visit the website also introduces the institute's core theme and purpose immediately, also creating an information architecture that communicates the essetnial information first while additionally encouraging users to scroll down and read on. </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="homeheader.png" alt="homescreen header" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> HRI landing page</figcaption>
      </figure>



      <p>Alternatively, the users are met with heavier text in the 'Welcome to the HRI' section underneath the header. This section is a rough overview of who the HRI are and what they do - with a more detailed description of the 'About Us Page'. </p>

      <p> This section is followed by a news carousel that the users are able to click through the latest HRI news and developments. This element was chosen not only to increase the level of interaction with the website, but also as an interesting way to present information that users can flick through as they please. This element also works as a nice juxatposition between the normal paragraph above it and below to keep the users interested as they scroll down the page. </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="news.png" alt="news carousel" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> news carousel</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p> Finally, the users are met with another section with some information about the research that the HRI conducts. This container was styled in the same way as the 'Welcome to the HRI' section above to create some cohesion on the page instead of creating a more cluttered page with another element/style of presenting the information. Having another more simple styled div also created some balance on the page between the amount of colour and graphics. </p>
			
		</section>

		<section id="ideation">
			<h2>Page Two: About Us</h2>
			<p> The About Us page was styled very similary to the proposed version in the proposal. The page opens up with another image header like the landing page and the title 'About Us' layered on top. </p>

      <p> Originally the image header was supposed to be white with a circular image on one side and the title off center beside it. This was changed to create some cohesion between the three different pages, and to eliminate any repetition of the circular style that runs throughout the website. These circular elements, like the two on the home page across from the 'Welcome to the HRI', were inspired by the viewport of a microscope which reflected the medical research theme that the HRI encapsulates. However, overusing this design pattern would make the website feel boring and repetitive. </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="aboutus1.png" alt="old about us header" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> Old about us header</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
          <img src="aboutus2.png" alt="new about us header" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> new about us header </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p> Following the paragraph describing the HRI, another large image in the same of the header, but with a small quote layered on top of it for emphasis. This quote box is used to break up the paragraphs of text and create some contrast between the white backgrounds and the colours of the image. This styling also emphasises the quote compared to the rest of the text. </p>

      <p> Finally, the 'Meet The Team' is an opportunuity for users to be introduced to the people who run the HRI. Instead of using blocks of text, images are used in the shape of a circle to concincide with the circular/microscope motif that runs throughout the website. When hovering over the circle, the names of the team member appear and the opacity of the circle halves. </p>
    
			<h2 id="moodboards"> Page Three: Donation Page</h2>
			<p> The donation page is the simpliest page out of the three on the website, consisting of just a fill out form for payment details to donate to the institute. Since the call to action is referred to throughout the website including in the nav bar, the footer and in the content itself, no extra text was needed to convince users to donate - the encouragement already exists across the other two pages. </p>

      <h2> The Footer </h2>
      <p> The footer of the website was designed very similarly to the header of the Welcome and About us pages - a large image as the background with text and buttons layered on top. The background could have simply been a solid colour, but an image background was chosen to adhere to the exsiting styling throughout the website, and also create some visual imagery to the call to actions to encourage users to carry out one of these actions. </p>

      <p> The footer acts as the main means for connecting the content on each page to the end of goal of carrying out one of the call to actions,creating an interconnected information architecture that builds a logical flow from content communication and understanding to action. </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="footer.png" alt="Website Footer " style="width:100%">
          <figcaption> Website Footer </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p> The footer also carries all of the HRI's social media links. Like the call to actions, encouraging support through social media in a non financial way is also one of the next steps and end goals after the page's content is read through. </p>
